# Portable version of browser for Windows
This is a portable version of <a href="https://github.com/a17sol/ProHiC">ProHiC browser</a>

To start using portable version, download the archive by clicking <a href="https://github.com/a17sol/ProHiC_portable/archive/master.zip">here</a>, unzip it, and double-click ProHiC.bat. The first time you start up, you have to give permission to run the file.

The portable version is rather large now due to numerous unused files in included standard packages. We are planning to reduce the size in future by removing them in accordance with license terms of the packages.
